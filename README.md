# Mtb-barcoding-amplicon

## Project Description
This project describes the computational workflow used to identify barcoded Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in tissue extracts from animals infected with a library of barcoded strains. More specifically, the workflow is applied to FASTQ files generated as follows: Animals are infected with a genetically barcoded strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), strain Erdman described in Martin CJ, Cadena AM, Leung VW, Lin PL, Maiello P, Hicks N, Chase MR, Flynn JL, Fortune SM. Digitally Barcoding Mycobacterium tuberculosis Reveals In Vivo Infection Dynamics in the Macaque Model of Tuberculosis. mBio. 2017 May 9;8(3):e00312-17. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00312-17. PMID: 28487426; PMCID: PMC5424202. Bacteria is cultured out of harvested tissues, followed by bacterial DNA extraction, and then the amplification of barcoded region using PCR. These amplicons are then pooled across tissues and subject to Illumina sequencing.

## File Guide
This project includes two perl scripts to process the fastq files in the analysis of this work. 

### Directory:
- ./scripts:
  - BarcodeReader.plx
  - FindThreshold.plx
    
### Tool versions:
  - Requires Perl, seqtk https://github.com/lh3/seqtk and the perl module Math::Derivative https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Derivative to be installed on your path.
  - To download the fastq files frm SRA you will also need to install sra-tools: https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools.

### Installation:
  - The tool versions can be manually installed in a unix like environment running bash. You can also install using a Anaconda environments.
  - `conda env create -f barcoding.yml`
  - In the script FindThreshold.plx change the path in `use lib '/n/boslfs02/LABS/sfortune_lab/Lab/envs/barcoding/lib/perl5/site_perl/';` to the path of your environment installation.

### Running the code:
- `mkdir myFolder && cd myFolder`
- `conda activate barcoding`
- `cp /path_to/BarcodeReader.plx .`
- `cp /path_to/FindThreshold.plx .`
- `mv fastq_files . `
- `perl BarcodeReader.plx`
- `perl FindThreshold.plx`
- output directory_name_threshold_data.csv
  
### Troubleshooting
